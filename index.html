    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>How does this work?</h3>
    <p>Just type in a gamertag in the format of the placeholder text and click "Grab skin". Within a few seconds, you will see the new skin.</p>
    <p>You can then use "Save Image As" or similar methods to download the skin to your device.</p>
    <h3>Is this safe?</h3>
    <p>Yes. You don't need to install software, nor does this site use bugs to install malware.</p>
    <h3>Why does this need to be Geyser-specific?</h3>
    <p>Because of the way Minecraft: Bedrock skins are transmitted, we have to use Geyser's cache to retrieve the skin.</p>
